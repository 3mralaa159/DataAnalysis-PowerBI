# **Airbnb Price Trend Analysis (New York City: 2019–2021)**

## **Overview**

This project analyzes Airbnb pricing trends for three property types (Entire Apartment, Entire House, Room in Hotel) in New York City from 2019 to 2021. The analysis focuses on identifying price trends, seasonal effects, and internal factors such as host type, response rates, and superhost status. Power BI was used to create visualizations and interpret insights from the dataset.

## **Key Observations**

### 1. **Overall Price Trends (2019–2021)**

- **Entire Apartment** and **Room in Hotel** showed a **steady downtrend** in average prices throughout the period.
- **Entire House** exhibited an **uptrend**, particularly noticeable from 2019 to mid-2020.
- The decline in prices for some property types may be associated with **external factors** such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which reduced demand for certain types of accommodations (especially in hotels and smaller apartments).

### 2. **Quarterly & Seasonal Patterns**

- **Entire Apartment**: Slight price increase in Q3 and Q4 of 2019, followed by a significant decrease in Q2 of 2020, potentially due to the pandemic. No data for 2021.
- **Entire House**: Strong price increase in 2019, with fluctuations in 2020, notably a rise from Q3 to Q4. This property type showed more resilience compared to others.
- **Room in Hotel**: Saw an initial rise in prices from Q1 to Q2 of 2019, followed by a decrease in Q3 and Q4. A similar pattern of increase in Q3 2020 suggests seasonal effects, particularly in summer.

### 3. **Host Type Influence**

- **Non-Superhosts** consistently priced properties higher than superhosts, especially for **Entire Apartments** and **Entire Houses**. This trend was evident across both higher and mid-range price segments.
- **Superhosts** generally offered lower average prices, possibly to maintain higher occupancy rates and attract guests through a reputation of reliable service.

### 4. **Host-Related Factors**

- **Host Response Rate**: No significant correlation between response rate and price was found.
- **Superhost Status**: Non-superhosts had higher average prices for all property types, a counterintuitive finding suggesting that non-superhosts may use higher pricing as a strategy to compensate for their lack of superhost status.
- **Number of Listings by Host**: No clear correlation between the number of listings a host manages and the price of properties. Many properties fell into a similar price range regardless of the host's portfolio size.

### 5. **Neighborhood Effects**

- Non-superhosts dominated in certain neighborhoods, especially in areas with **higher average prices**, contributing to the **higher pricing strategies** observed in these locations.
- Superhosts were more prevalent in areas with **lower average prices**, leading to more competitive pricing across various property types.
